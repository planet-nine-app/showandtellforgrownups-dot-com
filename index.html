    The idea: a meetup and space for grown ups to share things, and tell each other a bit about them. I had this idea literally yesterday as of the writing of this so it's still coming together. Thoughts and ideas welcome.

    I made a discord for this that you can join here: <a href="https://discord.gg/KbRgjEzj">https://discord.gg/KbRgjEzj</a>. I'm planetnineisaspaceship there.

  <br>
    For a number of reasons, other socials, and signups, and things like that aren't going to be something I can commit to. I have no qualms with someone else taking on that responsibility so if you're intested, let me know. Once the date and location is solidified I'll add this to meetup too, as that's a fine platform for meetups.
