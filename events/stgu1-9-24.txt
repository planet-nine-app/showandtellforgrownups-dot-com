## Show and Tell for Grown Ups

Last night was the inaugural Show and Tell for Grown Ups, and it was just a special night. There were nine show and tellers, and another nine or so spectators (including my 21 month old son who everyone was very gracious towards). People showed projects and hobbies close to their hearts. People shared life stories, and memories, and invited us to be a part of their communities for a moment. I saw things that I had never heard of before, and enjoyed an air of positivity amongst strangers that I haven't felt for a while.

I was initially worried that the meetup might be too tech heavy given the circles that I run in, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that thread and yarn was featured in the first three show and tells (should I abbreviate this as SaTs? shows doesn't seem right, and I don't want to say projects or something like that). Comparatively there were only two tech show and tells, and in their defence, one also featured yarn, and the other a magic wand.

Do you know what a glucophone is? I didn't. It's also called a tongue drum... which I also didn't know. I also didn't know that Cindarella's big spinning setup wasn't invented until the 16th century so
